# Ookii.VmSockets

Ookii.VmSockets is a library that provides support for Hyper-V sockets (hvsocket) and Linux VSock
sockets for .Net applications. Both are used to communicate between the host and a guest virtual
machine, on Windows Hyper-V and on Linux respectively. It's also possible for a Linux guest,
including the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), using VSock to communicate with a Windows host
using Hyper-V sockets.
